## 🔍 Project Overview

This project explores the various factors that affect **student performance**, both academically and personally. Using **machine learning** techniques, we aim to:

- 🧠 **Predict student grades** based on key factors from the dataset.
- 📈 Assess the **external influences** on academic success, including personal habits and environment.
- 🤖 Evaluate whether the **dataset** is reliable for making accurate predictions using machine learning models.
- 💡 Provide insights on **improving study habits** to enhance academic performance.

### Why This Project? 🎯

As students, we're particularly focused on identifying the most significant factors influencing academic success, both inside and outside the classroom. This project will help us understand how factors like **sleep**, **physical activity**, and **peer influence** contribute to better performance, and will also determine whether the dataset itself is a strong foundation for making reliable predictions.
