## 🔍 Project Overview

This project aims to investigate the factors that influence **student performance**, focusing on both academic and personal life variables. Using cutting-edge **machine learning** techniques, we aim to:

- 🧠 Predict **student grades** based on various factors.
- 📈 Understand the **external influences** that contribute to academic success.
- 💡 Provide insights into **improving study habits** for better performance.

### Why This Project? 🎯

As students ourselves, we're particularly concerned with identifying which factors—whether academic or personal—have the **greatest impact** on performance. By exploring influences such as **hours of sleep**, **physical activity**, and **peer interactions**, we hope to uncover patterns that go beyond the classroom and provide valuable advice for a more successful learning experience.
