## üìä Data Set

**Data Set used :**

[![Kaggle Data Set (Kaggle)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kaggle%20Data%20Set-Kaggle-blue?style=flat-square)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/chess/data)
[![Elite Data Set (Nikonoel)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Elile%20Data%20Set-Nikonoel-blue?style=flat-square)](https://database.nikonoel.fr/)


### Data Set Description

The Kaggle Data Set contains around **20,000 chess games** with the following columns:
- `id`: Game ID
- `rated`: Whether the game is rated
- `created_at`: Date and time the game was created
- `last_move_at`: Date and time of the last move
- `turns`: Number of turns in the game
- `victory_status`: Game outcome (mate, draw, resign, outoftime)
- `winner`: Winner of the game (white, black, draw)
- `increment_code`: Increment code ([time control](https://www.chess.com/terms/chess-time-controls))
- `white_id`: White player ID
- `white_rating`: White player rating
- `black_id`: Black player ID
- `black_rating`: Black player rating
- `moves`: Moves in standard chess notation 
- `opening_eco`: Opening code ([List](https://www.365chess.com/eco.php))
- `opening_name`: Opening name
- `opening_ply`: Number of opening moves

The data set comes from the [Lichess](https://lichess.org/) website, which is a free online chess game platform.

After analysing the data, we found that the Kaggle dataset do not contain enough observations.
Lichess provides a database of **Every game played on Lichess** on its [webstie](https://database.lichess.org/).
To decided to use the **Lichess Elite Database** which contains all the 2300 elo or more game datas. 
Elo corresponds to the player's rating, which is a measure of the player's skill level. The higher the Elo, the better the player.
2300 elo is the minimum rating to be considered a ***master*** in chess. 
The high quality games in the database might help us to have a more accurate prediction.


### Important columns : 

#### Prepocessing :

Before beginning the statistic analysis we need to make sure that the data is clean and ready to be used.

So for this we erased the lines that had missing values. There was some games that were repeating themselves , so we erased them too to let only 1 left in the dataset.

#### Turns : 

This column shows us the number of turns in the game. It is a good indicator of the game length. This column will be useful for the project and for the learning model that we will use.

![turns distribution](/images/turns_distribution.png)

We can see a pin around 50 turns . This is normal because the average game length is around 40 turns. Then we have some extra values that are higher than 100 turns. 


#### Ranking : 

The rank of each player is important, it tells us the difference of level between 2 players and there knowledge of the game.

We can see that the white and black rating are the same :

| white_rating | black_rating | raking difference |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
![rating distribution](/images/white_rating.png)|![rating distribution](/images/black_rating.png)|![rating distrib](/images/rating_difference.png)

We see that the ranking difference between the players is not important and we can assume that the players have the same levels.

#### correlation matrix

To help us with every features presents in the dataset. With this feature we can see the correlation between each features and the target variable.

## üîç Project Overview

This project explores the various factors that affect **game outcomes**. Using **machine learning** techniques, we aim to:

- üèÜ **Predict the winner** of a game based on key factors from the dataset.
- üèÖ**Classify the best opening moves** to increase the chances of winning.
- ‚ùì**Identify Blunders or Critical Position** to detect the **turning points** of the game.
- ‚ôüÔ∏è**Evaluate the best move** to make in a given position.
- üìà Assess the **influences** on game outcomes, including player statistics and game conditions.
- ü§ñ Evaluate whether the **dataset** is reliable for making accurate predictions using machine learning models.
- üöÄ **Improve our understanding of AI** and its applications in analyzing game data.

### Why This Project? üéØ

We are big fans of games and are interested in understanding the factors that contribute to winning. This project helps us explore how factors like **player ratings**, **game time**, and **opening moves** influence the outcome of a game.
As computer science students, we aim to **enhance our knowledge of artificial intelligence** by applying it to real-world data and evaluating how effective the dataset is in making reliable predictions.

## üî¨ Methodology
### Data Preprocessing
TBW

### Existing Models

Chess is very famous in the AI community, and many models have been developed to predict the best move in a given position such as **AlphaZero** and **Stockfish**. To help us develop our own, we will use these models. (see more : [Chess Engine](Chess_Project/Chess%20Engine))

#### AlphaZero

AlphaZero is a computer program developed by Google DeepMind in 2017. It uses the same reinforcement learning techniques as AlphaGo Zero, but it is also trained on chess. AlphaZero is a general-purpose algorithm that can learn to play other games as well. It uses a deep neural network to evaluate positions and select moves.

#### Stockfish

Stockfish is a free and open-source chess engine developed by Tord Romstad, Marco Costalba, and Joona Kiiski. It is one of the strongest chess engines in the world. Stockfish uses alpha-beta pruning and other techniques to evaluate positions and select moves. The evaluation function is based on material balance, piece mobility, pawn structure, king safety, and other factors and is entirely handcrafted.
