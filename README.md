## 🔍 Project Overview

This project explores the various factors that affect **game outcomes**. Using **machine learning** techniques, we aim to:

- 🏆 **Predict the winner** of a game based on key factors from the dataset.
- 📈 Assess the **influences** on game outcomes, including player statistics and game conditions.
- 🤖 Evaluate whether the **dataset** is reliable for making accurate predictions using machine learning models.
- 💡 Provide insights on **improving game strategies** to enhance performance.
- 🚀 **Improve our understanding of AI** and its applications in analyzing game data.

### Why This Project? 🎯

We are big fans of games and are interested in understanding the factors that contribute to winning. This project helps us explore how factors like **player ratings**, **game time**, and **opening moves** influence the outcome of a game.
As computer science students, we aim to **enhance our knowledge of artificial intelligence** by applying it to real-world data and evaluating how effective the dataset is in making reliable predictions.

> **Disclaimer:** Note: This project follows a previous one on student performance, which we found less engaging ([Student performance](Data Analysis)).
