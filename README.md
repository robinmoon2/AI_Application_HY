## Project Overview
This project investigates the factors that influence student performance, focusing not only on academic but also on personal and lifestyle variables. Using machine learning techniques, we aim to predict student grades and understand the external factors that contribute to success.

Our objective is to develop knowledge on how artificial intelligence works in analyzing these factors and to apply this knowledge to improve our own study habits. As students, we are particularly interested in identifying which areas (both academic and personal) have the greatest impact on performance, providing insights that go beyond the classroom to include aspects like sleep, physical activity, and peer influence.
